      More on window below.
      When "manual-*" lights are the oposite of the auto setting.
      If the state is "manual-o" and we are inside the window, or if
      the state is "manual-i" and we are outside the window, set the
      state to auto.

      There are various ways to set the "manual-*" state, including
      by button press on the plug devices.  If the button is set
      and we are in manual-*, set it to auto.  IF the button is set
      and we are in auto, set to manual-i if inside the window, and
      manual-o if we are outside the window.
