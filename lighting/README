Daemon to automate control of lights
Uses mqtt for both control and state

Note that all messages are to be sent as persistent
Messages that are really commands will be deleted by the controller
as a way of acknowledging processing that command

Messages that are internal state and should NOT be messed with

    lighting/<region>/control
      Values are "auto", "manual-o", "manual-i"
      When "auto" lights are off outside the window, and on inside the window.
      More on window below.
      When "manual-*" lights are the oposite of the auto setting.
      If the state is "manual-o" and we are inside the window, or if
      the state is "manual-i" and we are outside the window, set the
      state to auto.

      There are various ways to set the "manual-*" state, including
      by button press on the plug devices.  If the button is set
      and we are in manual-*, set it to auto.  IF the button is set
      and we are in auto, set to manual-i if inside the window, and
      manual-o if we are outside the window.

    lighting/<region>/state
      values are "on" and "off".  Current state of the lights.
